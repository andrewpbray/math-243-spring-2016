### Statistics

For review of the fundamental concepts of statistics, see [OpenIntro: Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation](https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs) (2014), by Diez, Barr and Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, available in three formats: pdf, tablet-friendly pdf, and paperback edition. The textbook is free and open-source. For general concepts
of data and inference, see chapters 1 and 2. For regression, see chapters 5 and 6.


### Computing

#### R

If you're new to R or need a refresher, there are some short free online courses
that can be helpful. I recommend [Datacamp: Intro to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r). There is also a free
online reference book for the fundamentals of the R languaged called [Cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/).

Once you're up and running, it can be helpful to have the most important information
distilled into one sheet of paper. RStudio puts out several great ones including
the [Visualization Cheatsheet (ggplot2)](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf)
and the [Data Wrangling Cheatsheet (dplyr)](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf).

If you imagine yourself using R and RStudio after this course and after
Reed, you should get it setup on your own machine. [This tutorial](http://www.reed.edu/data-at-reed/software/R/r_studio.html) will walk
you through all the downloading, installing, and configuration.

#### R Markdown
R Markdown is a very important tool to enable data analysis that is completely
transparent and easily reproducible. [These slides](https://prezi.com/dvmgx17e_was/reproducible/) walk through the motivation
and basic structure of R Markdown while [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNS7i2m4sB0) is a good walkthrough to making
your first R Markdown document.

For all the important ideas summarized into a single place, you can use the [R Markdown cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf).
