#### Chapter 3 exercises
1, 4, 5, 6

#### Additional exercises
1. **Challenge problem**: Use the identities for expected value and variance to derive the bias-variance decomposition of $E\left[ \left(y - \hat{f}(x) \right)^2 \right]$.

- $E(c) = c$, where $c$ is a constant.
- $Var(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2$
