## Algorithm 10.2 {.build}

1. Begin with $n$ observations and a dissimilarity matrix. Treat each observation as its own cluster.
2. For $i = n, n - 1, \ldots, 2$:
    - Examine all pairwise inter-cluster dissimilarities and identify the pair that are most similar. Fuse these clusters at the dendrogram height corresponding to their dissimilarity.
    - Compute pairwise dissimilarities among remaining 1 - i clusters.
    

## Linkage types {.build}

**Complete**: Maximal intercluster dissimilarity.

**Single**: Minimal intercluster dissimilarity.

**Average**: Mean intercluster dissimiliarity.

**Centroid**: Dissimilarity between cluster centroids.
