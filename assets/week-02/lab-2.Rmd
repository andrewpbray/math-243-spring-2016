### Fijian Earthquakes

1000 large seimic events around Fiji have been collected in a data set called
`quakes` that is built into R.  You can learn more about it with the following
commands:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data(quakes)
str(quakes)
?quakes
```

#### Earthquake detection

Included in the data set is a column recording the number of stations that
detected each earthquake. This refers to a global network of seismographs and it stands
to reason that the larger the quake, the more widely it will be detected.

1. Create a plot of the relationship between `stations` and `magnitude`.  How would you 
characterize the relationship? (If you see overplotting, you may want to add
`jitter` to your points or make them transparent by playing with the `alpha` value.)

2. Before you go ahead and fit a linear model to this trend, if in fact there 
was *no relationship* between the two, what would you expect the slope to be?
What about the intercept?

3. Ok, now go ahead and fit a linear model called `m1` to the trend and add that
line to the plot from exercise 1. Interpret your slope and intercept in the context
of the problem.

4. Verify the way that `lm()` has computed your slope correctly by using R
to do the calculation using the equation for the slope based on X and Y.

5. Using R, calculate a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the model that you 
fit in exercise 3.  Confirm the calculation using `confint()`.

6. How many stations do you predict would be able to detect an earthquake of 
magnitude 7.0?

7. Questions 1 - 6 in this lab involve elements of *data description*, *inference*,
and/or *prediction*. Which was the dominant goal in each question?

#### Simulation

One good way to assess whether your fitted model seems appropriate is to simulate
data from it and see if it looks like the data that you observed. For the following
questions it will be useful to reference the R code provided in the previous two
lectures.

9. Please simulate a data set that has the same number of observations as `quakes`. To
start, generate a vector of x's. You can either generate your own x's or use the
exact same x's as the `quakes` data.

10. Next, generate your $\hat{y}$'s (the value of the mean function at the observed
x's). Please generate them by writing your own function of the form:

```{r}
f_hat <- function(x) {
  # code goes here
}
```

11. Now, generate the y's. Note that you'll need an estimate of $\sigma^2$,
for which you can use $\hat{\sigma}^2 = RSS/n - 2$. You can extract the vector
of residuals with `m1$res`.

12. Finally, make a plot of your simulated data. How is it similar to the original
data? How is it different? How might you chance your model to make it more 
consistent with the data?

**Challenge problem**
Use the latitude and longitude data to plot each of these earthquakes in `quakes` 
on a map with their magnitude mapped to the size of the plotting character. You 
may need to all some transparency to prevent overplotting.
