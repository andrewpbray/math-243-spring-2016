# Random Forests

## Review {.build}

### Goal
Decrease the variance of our estimates.

### Strategies

**Bagging**: create many **b**oostrapped data sets, fit a full tree to each, then **agg*regate the predictions.

**Random Forests**: perform bagging, but for each tree, at each split, only consider $m \le p$ predictors.
