Statistical Learning is a field that ties together statistical theory and practice
with the methods of machine learning have emerged in the last several decades.

This course is geared towards students with the following experience.

- Exposure and understanding of the fundamental concepts of linear regression: 
What is it used for? How does one interpret the parameter estimates? What does
inference mean in this context?
- Experience with a programming language. We will use R in this course, but it
will be easy enough to learn if you've worked before with Python, Java, Matlab, 
etc.

If you've taken Math 141, you have these bases covered. In terms of the
mathematical notation, we will be using the vector/matrix formulation in places,
though knowledge of linear algebra is not necessary.

### Textbook
[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf) (2013),
by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. The pdf is available for free and the
printed book is available from the bookstore for around $60. The textbook is a key 
component of the course and I recommend having a hardcopy on hand if possible.


### Class components

This course has three components: problem sets, labs, and exams/quizzes. For details
on the first two, see the tabs at the top of the page.


#### Exams

We'll have several examinations and quizzes throughout the semester in order to challenge
your understanding and provide us with a sense of where you're at. Some will
be more traditional pen and paper and others are to be done with the computer
using R.
