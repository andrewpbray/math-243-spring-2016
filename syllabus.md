Welcome to the Age of Data, where information is all around us, helping us live 
happier, healthier lives. Or does it? Do we know yet if cell phones cause 
cancer? Have we come to a decision on whether we should be eating lots of meat 
or none at all to stay healthy? Despite all of this information, it can be 
challenging to turn it into the knowledge from which we can make sound
decisions.

Statistics is the field that aims to bridge this gap between information and 
knowledge and this course is an application-oriented introduction to modern 
statistical modeling and inference. We will discuss topics such as: study design, 
descriptive statistics, data visualization, random variables, probability and 
sampling distributions, point and interval estimates, hypothesis tests, 
resampling procedures, multiple regression, and Bayesian models. A wide variety 
of applications from the natural and social sciences will be used.

### Textbook
[An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf) (2013),
by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani. The pdf is available for free and the
printed book is available from the bookstore for $60. This book is excellent and
I recommend having a hardcopy on hand.

The textbook is a key component of the course. Our class will maintain a reading
group at [nb.mit.edu](http://nb.mit.edu), which provides us with a 
communal annotation engine. You will be asked to make and respond to reading 
notes online, as class time will focus on activities to help understand concepts.

### Class components

This course has three components: Problem Sets, Labs, and Exams/Quizzes. For details
on the first two, see the tabs at the top of the page.


#### Exams

We'll have several examinations and quizzes throughout the semester in order to challenge
your understanding and provide us with a sense of where you're at. Some will
be more traditional pen and paper and others are to be done with the computer
using R.
