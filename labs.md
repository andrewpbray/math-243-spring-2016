We dedicate every Friday to gaining experience with these methods and
concepts in a computing environment. Our tool of choice will be R, software that
vastly amplifies your power to explore, visualize, and model data. Reed's RStudio
server is accessible by going to [https://rstudio.reed.edu/](https://rstudio.reed.edu/) 
and using your college login.

Every week you'll be working with a new data set and organizing your work in an
RMarkdown document. You should complete work on your lab by **Tuesday** at 11:59 PM.
