We dedicate every Friday to gaining experience with these methods and
concepts in a computing environment. Our tool of choice will be R, software that
vastly amplifies your power to explore, visualize, and model data. Reed's RStudio
server is accessible by going to [https://rstudio.reed.edu/](https://rstudio.reed.edu/) 
and using your college login. Note that to access the server from off-campus,
you'll need to go through a VPN. You can apply to CUS for access by filling out
[this form](https://docs.google.com/a/reed.edu/forms/d/1oMG4c732c2CAPXr9oGni45lz3-UyDKIfKPMaXKXH6pU/viewform).

Every week you'll be working with a new data set and organizing your work in an
RMarkdown document. You should complete work on your lab by **Tuesday** at 11:59 PM.
